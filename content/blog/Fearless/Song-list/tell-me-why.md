I took a chance, I took a shot <br />
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not <br />
You took a swing, I took it hard <br />
And down here from the ground, I see who you are <br />
I'm sick and tired of your attitude <br />
I'm feeling like I don't know you <br />
You tell me that you love me, then you cut me down <br />
And I need you like a heartbeat <br />
But you know you got a mean streak <br />
Makes me run for cover when you're around <br />
And here's to you and your temper <br />
Yes, I remember what you said last night <br />
And I know that you see what you're doing to me <br />
Tell me why <br />
You could write a book on <br />
How to ruin someone's perfect day <br />
Well, I get so confused and frustrated <br />
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh <br />
I'm sick and tired of your reasons <br />
I got no one to believe in <br />
You tell me that you want me, then push me around <br />
And I need you like a heartbeat <br />
But you know you got a mean streak <br />
Makes me run for cover when you're around <br />
Here's to you and your temper <br />
Yes, I remember what you said last night <br />
And I know that you see what you're doing to me <br />
Tell me why <br />
Why do you have to make me feel small <br />
So you can feel whole inside? <br />
Why do you have to put down my dreams <br />
So you're the only thing on my mind? <br />
When I'm sick and tired of your attitude <br />
I'm feeling like I don't know you <br />
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down <br />
I'm sick and tired of your reasons <br />
I've got no one to believe in <br />
You ask me for my love, then you push me around <br />
Here's to you and your temper <br />
Yes, I remember what you said last night <br />
And I know that you see what you're doing to me <br />
Tell me why, why? <br />
Tell me why <br />
I take a step back, let you go <br />
I told you I'm not bulletproof <br />
Now you know <br />
