I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on <br />
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run <br />
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides <br />
Look now, the sky is gold <br />
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home <br />
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall <br />
I know you're not scared of anything at all <br />
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away <br />
But I know I had the best day with you today <br />
I'm 13 now and don't know how my friends could be so mean <br />
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys <br />
And we drive and drive until we've found a town far enough away <br />
And we talk and window shop 'til I forgot all their names <br />
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school <br />
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you <br />
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay <br />
But I know I had the best day with you today <br />
I have an excellent father <br />
His strength is making me stronger <br />
God smiles on my little brother <br />
Inside and out he's better than I am <br />
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run <br />
And I had the best days with you <br />
There is a video I found from back when I was three <br />
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me <br />
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships <br />
And the seven dwarves <br />
And Daddy's smart <br />
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world <br />
And now I know why all the trees change in the Fall <br />
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong <br />
And I love you for giving me your eyes <br />
For staying back and watching me shine and <br />
I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say <br />
That I had the best day with you today <br />
 <br />
