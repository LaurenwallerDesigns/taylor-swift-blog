I see your face in my mind as I drive away <br />
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way <br />
People are people and sometimes we change our minds <br />
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time <br />
Mm-mmm, mm-mm-mm-mmm <br />
Mm-mmm, mm-mm-mm-mmm <br />
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie <br />
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see <br />
'Cause it's tragedy, and it'll only bring you down <br />
Now I don't know what to be without you around <br />
And we know it's never simple, never easy <br />
Never a clean break, no one here to save me <br />
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand <br />
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to <br />
Breathe without you, but I have to <br />
Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt <br />
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve <br />
People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out <br />
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout <br />
And we know it's never simple, never easy <br />
Never a clean break, no one here to save me <br />
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand <br />
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to <br />
Breathe without you, but I have to <br />
It's 2 a.m., feeling like I just lost a friend <br />
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me <br />
It's 2 a.m., feeling like I just lost a friend <br />
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me <br />
And we know it's never simple, never easy <br />
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh <br />
I can't breathe without you, but I have to <br />
Breathe without you, but I have to <br />
Breathe without you, but I have to <br />
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm) <br />
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (yeah) <br />
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry (ooh) <br />
