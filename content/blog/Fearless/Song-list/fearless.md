<p className="verse-one">
There's somethin' bout the way <br />
The street looks when it's just rained <br />
There's a glow off the pavement <br />
You walk me to the car <br />
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there <br />
In the middle of the parking lot <br />
Yeah <br />
Oh, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
We're drivin' down the road <br />
I wonder if you know <br />
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now <br />
But you're just so cool <br />
Run your hands through your hair <br />
Absent mindedly makin' me want you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I don't know how it gets better than this <br />
You take my hand and drag me head first <br />
Fearless <br />
And I don't know why <br />
But with you I'd dance in a storm <br />
In my best dress <br />
Fearless <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
So baby drive slow <br />
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town <br />
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat <br />
You put your eyes on me <br />
In this moment now capture it, remember it <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this <br />
You take my hand and drag me head first <br />
Fearless <br />
And I don't know why <br />
But with you I'd dance in a storm <br />
In my best dress <br />
Fearless <br />
Oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Well you stood there with me in the doorway <br />
My hands shake <br />
I'm not usually this way but <br />
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave <br />
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something,  <br />it's fearless
Oh, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this <br />
You take my hand and drag me head first <br />
Fearless <br />
And I don't know why <br />
But with you I'd dance in a storm <br />
In my best dress <br />
Fearless <br />
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this <br />
You take my hand and drag me head first <br />
Fearless <br />
And I don't know why <br />
But with you I'd dance in a storm <br />
In my best dress <br />
Fearless <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, oh, oh yeah <br />
