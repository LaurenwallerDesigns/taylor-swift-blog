quote: 'It was just about comparing the fairytale imagery we are taught as kids to what can really happen in young love and young heartbreak, and how you just expect a ‘happily ever after’ type thing. It’s like that coming of age where you realize you’re stronger than wanting that happily ever after, you want something better for yourself.'

<p className="verse-one">
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel <br />
Comes out just when you need it to <br />
As I paced back and forth all this time <br />
'Cause I honestly believed in you <br />
Holdin' on, the days drag on <br />
Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale <br />
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet <br />
Lead her up the stairwell <br />
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town <br />
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down <br />
Now it's too late for you and your white horse <br />
To come around <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes <br />
And never really had a chance <br />
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love <br />
You had to fight to have the upper hand <br />
I had so many dreams about you and me <br />
Happy endings, now I know <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale <br />
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet <br />
Lead her up the stairwell <br />
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town <br />
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down <br />
Now it's too late for you and your white horse <br />
To come around <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And there you are on your knees <br />
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me <br />
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale <br />
I'm gonna find someone someday <br />
Who might actually treat me well <br />
This is a big world, that was a small town <br />
There in my rear-view mirror disappearing now <br />
And it's too late for you and your white horse <br />
Now it's too late for you and your white horse <br />
To catch me now <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa <br />
Try and catch me now, oh <br />
It's too late <br />
To catch me now <br />
</p>
