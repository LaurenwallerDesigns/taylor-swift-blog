quote: ‘You Belong With Me’ is a song that just absolutely changed my life. It was one of those songs that I had written about unrequited love and crushes at school. And I never would have imagined how many people I would see in a crowd one day screaming, ‘She wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts,’ or there would be think pieces about it or that it would be this thing that launched me and my career into this place that I never imagined it would go to. It was this song and ‘Love Story’ that really, really changed my life in a huge way. And I’ve had so much fun with the fans singing this into crowds over the years. So, getting to redo it was really a joyful experience. ‘Cause I kind of was looking back on all of those memories and thinking, 'Wow, I’m really lucky.’

<p className="verse-one">
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset <br />
She's going off about something that you said <br />
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do <br />
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night <br />
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like <br />
And she'll never know your story like I do <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But she wears short skirts <br />
I wear T-shirts <br />
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers <br />
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find <br />
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
If you could see that I'm the one <br />
Who understands you <br />
Been here all along <br />
So, why can't you see? <br />
You belong with me <br />
You belong with me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Walking the streets with you in your worn-out jeans <br />
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be <br />
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself <br />
Hey, isn't this easy? <br />
And you've got a smile <br />
That can light up this whole town <br />
I haven't seen it in a while <br />
Since she brought you down <br />
You say you're fine, I know you better than that <br />
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
She wears high heels <br />
I wear sneakers <br />
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers <br />
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find <br />
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
If you could see that I'm the one <br />
Who understands you <br />
Been here all along <br />
So, why can't you see? <br />
You belong with me <br />
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor <br />
All this time how could you not know, baby? <br />
You belong with me <br />
You belong with me <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Oh, I remember you driving to my house <br />
In the middle of the night <br />
I'm the one who makes you laugh <br />
When you know you're 'bout to cry <br />
And I know your favorite songs <br />
And you tell me 'bout your dreams <br />
Think I know where you belong <br />
Think I know it's with me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Can't you see that I'm the one <br />
Who understands you? <br />
Been here all along <br />
So, why can't you see? <br />
You belong with me <br />
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor <br />
All this time how could you not know, baby? <br />
You belong with me <br />
You belong with me <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You belong with me <br />
Have you ever thought just maybe <br />
You belong with me? <br />
You belong with me <br />
</p>
