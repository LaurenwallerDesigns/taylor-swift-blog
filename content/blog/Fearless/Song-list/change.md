And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you <br />
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and <br />
You know it's all the same, another time and place <br />
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it <br />
But I believe in whatever you do <br />
And I'll do anything to see it through <br />
Because these things will change <br />
Can you feel it now? <br />
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down <br />
It's a revolution, the time will come <br />
For us to finally win <br />
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah <br />
So we've been outnumbered <br />
Raided and now cornered <br />
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair <br />
We're getting stronger now <br />
Find things they never found <br />
They might be bigger <br />
But we're faster and never scared <br />
You can walk away, say we don't need this <br />
But there's something in your eyes <br />
Says we can beat this <br />
Because these things will change <br />
Can you feel it now? <br />
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down <br />
It's a revolution, the time will come <br />
For us to finally win <br />
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah <br />
Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees <br />
Fight for what we've worked for all these years <br />
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives <br />
But we'll stand up champions tonight <br />
It was the night things changed <br />
Can you see it now? <br />
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down <br />
It's a revolution, throw your hands up <br />
'Cause we never gave in <br />
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah <br />
Hallelujah <br />
