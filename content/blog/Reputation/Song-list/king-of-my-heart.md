<p className='verse-one'>
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own <br />
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone <br />
We met a few weeks ago <br />
Now you try on callin' me, baby, like tryin' on clothes <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
Salute to me, I'm your American Queen <br />
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat <br />
And we rule the kingdom inside my room <br />
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars <br />
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars <br />
Never took me quite where you do <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for <br />
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go <br />
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting <br />
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting <br />
Body and soul, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-two'>
Late in the night, the city's asleep <br />
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep <br />
Change my priorities <br />
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
Salute to me, I'm your American Queen <br />
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat <br />
And we rule the kingdom inside my room (inside my room, oh) <br />
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars <br />
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars <br />
Never took me quite where you do (where you do) <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for <br />
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go <br />
King of my heart (my heart), body and soul, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once (hey), I've been waiting, waiting (waiting) <br />
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting (waiting), waiting (waiting) <br />
Body and soul, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once <br />
</p>
<p className='bridge'>
Is this the end of all the endings? <br />
My broken bones are mending <br />
With all these nights we're spending <br />
Up on the roof with a school girl crush <br />
Drinking beer out of plastic cups <br />
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff <br />
Baby, all at once, this is enough <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for <br />
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for <br />
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go <br />
King of my heart (my heart), body and soul (my soul), ooh whoa <br />
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting <br />
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa (ooh whoa) <br />
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting <br />
Body and soul, ooh whoa <br />
And all at once <br />
</p>
