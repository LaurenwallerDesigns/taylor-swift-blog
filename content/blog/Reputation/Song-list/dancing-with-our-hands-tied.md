<p className='verse-one'>
I, I loved you in secret <br />
First sight, yeah, we love without reason <br />
Oh, twenty-five years old <br />
Oh, how were you to know, and <br />
My, my love had been frozen <br />
Deep blue, but you painted me golden <br />
Oh, and you held me close <br />
Oh, how was I to know that <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets <br />
Picture of your face in an invisible locket <br />
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it <br />
I had a bad feeling <br />
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis <br />
People started talking, putting us through our paces <br />
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it <br />
I had a bad feeling <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
But we were dancing <br />
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Like it was the first time, first time <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
And I had a bad feeling <br />
But we were dancing <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-two'>
I, I loved you in spite of <br />
Deep fears that the world would divide us <br />
So, baby, can we dance <br />
Oh, through an avalanche? <br />
And say, say that we got it <br />
<strong className='fav-line'>
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted <br />
</strong>
Oh, 'cause it's gravity <br />
Oh, keeping you with me <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets <br />
Picture of your face in an invisible locket <br />
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
I had a bad feeling <br />
But we were dancing <br />
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Like it was the first time, first time <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
(Ooh, we had our hands tied) <br />
And I had a bad feeling <br />
But we were dancing <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'd kiss you as the lights went out <br />
Swaying as the room burned down <br />
I'd hold you as the water rushes in <br />
If I could dance with you again <br />
I'd kiss you as the lights went out <br />
Swaying as the room burned down <br />
I'd hold you as the water rushes in <br />
If I could dance with you again <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Like it was the first time, first time <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
And I had a bad feeling <br />
But we were dancing <br />
Hands tied, hands tied <br />
