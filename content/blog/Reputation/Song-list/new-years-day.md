<p className="verse-one">
There's glitter on the floor after the party  <br />
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby <br />
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor <br />
You and me from the night before, but <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't read the last page <br />
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared, and you're turning away <br />
I want your midnights <br />
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi <br />
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road <br />
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe <br />
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't read the last page <br />
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong, or we're making mistakes <br />
I want your midnights <br />
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day <br />
</p>
<p className="Bridge">
Hold on to the memories <br />
They will hold on to you <br />
Hold on to the memories <br />
They will hold on to you <br />
Hold on to the memories <br />
They will hold on to you <br />
And I will hold on to you <br />
Please don't ever become a stranger <br />
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere <br />
Please don't ever become a stranger <br />
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
There's glitter on the floor after the party <br />
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby <br />
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor <br />
You and me, forevermore <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Don't read the last page <br />
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong, or we're making mistakes <br />
I want your midnights <br />
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Hold on to the memories <br />
They will hold on to you <br />
Hold on to the memories <br />
They will hold on to you <br />
Hold on to the memories <br />
They will hold on to you <br />
And I will hold on to you <br />
Please don't ever become a stranger (hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you) <br />
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere (hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you) <br />
Please don't ever become a stranger (hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you) <br />
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere (I will hold on to you) <br />
