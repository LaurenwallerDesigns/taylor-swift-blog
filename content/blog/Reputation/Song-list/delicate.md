<p className="pre-chorus">
This ain't for the best <br />
My reputation's never been worse, so <br />
You must like me for me <br />
We can't make any promises <br />
Now can we, babe? <br />
But you can make me a drink <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at? <br />
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black <br />
Come here; you can meet me in the back <br />
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you <br />
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue <br />
Just think of the fun things we could do <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause I like you <br />
This ain't for the best <br />
My reputation's never been worse, so <br />
You must like me for me <br />
Yeah, I want you <br />
We can't make any promises <br />
Now can we, babe? <br />
But you can make me a drink <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Is it cool that I said all that? <br />
Is it chill that you're in my head? <br />
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate) <br />
Is it cool that I said all that? <br />
Is it too soon to do this yet? <br />
'Cause I know that it's delicate <br />
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it? <br />
Isn't it? <br />
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it? <br />
Isn't it delicate? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Third floor on the West Side, me and you <br />
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view <br />
Do the girls back home touch you like I do? <br />
Long night with your hands up in my hair <br />
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs <br />
Stay here, honey, I don't want to share <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause I like you <br />
This ain't for the best <br />
My reputation's never been worse, so  <br />
You must like me for me <br />
Yeah, I want you <br />
We can't make any promises <br />
Now can we, babe? <br />
But you can make me a drink <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Is it cool that I said all that? <br />
Is it chill that you're in my head? <br />
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate) <br />
Is it cool that I said all that? <br />
Is it too soon to do this yet? <br />
'Cause I know that it's delicate <br />
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it? <br />
Isn't it? <br />
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it? <br />
Isn't it delicate? <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Sometimes I wonder; when you sleep <br />
Are you ever dreaming of me? <br />
Sometimes when I look into your eyes <br />
<strong className='fav-line'>
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time <br />

'Cause I like you <br />
Is it cool that I said all that? <br />
Is it chill that you're in my head? <br />
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate) <br />
Yeah, I want you <br />

'Cause I like you <br />
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?) <br />
Is it chill that you're in my head? (Isn't it, isn't it?) <br />
