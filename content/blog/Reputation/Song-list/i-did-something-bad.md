<p className="verse-one">
I never trust a narcissist <br />
But they love me <br />
So I play 'em like a violin <br />
And I make it look oh so easy <br />
'Cause for every lie I tell them <br />
They tell me three <br />
This is how the world works <br />
Now all he thinks about is me <br />
I can feel the flames on my skin <br />
Crimson red paint on my lips <br />
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing <br />
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
They say I did something bad <br />
Then why's it feel so good? <br />
They say I did something bad <br />
But why's it feel so good? <br />
Most fun I ever had <br />
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could <br />
It just felt so good, good <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I never trust a playboy <br />
But they love me <br />
So I fly him all around the world <br />
And I let them think they saved me <br />
They never see it comin' <br />
What I do next <br />
This is how the world works <br />
You gotta leave before you get left <br />
I can feel the flames on my skin <br />
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing" <br />
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin' <br />
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin' <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
They say I did something bad <br />
Then why's it feel so good? <br />
They say I did something bad <br />
But why's it feel so good? <br />
Most fun I ever had <br />
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could <br />
It just felt so good, good <br />
It just felt so good <br />

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one <br />
They got their pitchforks and proof <br />
Their receipts and reasons <br />
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one <br />
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up) <br />
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up) <br />
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up) <br />
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up) <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
They say I did something bad <br />
Then why's it feel so good? <br />
They say I did something bad <br />
But why's it feel so good? <br />
Most fun I ever had <br />
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could <br />
It just felt so good, good <br />
Oh, you say I did something bad <br />
Then why's it feel so good, good? <br />
So bad, why's it feel so good? <br />
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad) <br />
It just felt so good, good <br />
