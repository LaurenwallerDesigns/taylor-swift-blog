<p className="verse-one">
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights <br />
Busy streets and busy lives <br />
And all we know is touch and go <br />
We are alone with our changing minds <br />
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I never (never) <br />
Saw you coming <br />
And I'll never (never) <br />
Be the same <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You come around and the armor falls <br />
Pierce the room like a cannonball <br />
Now all we know is don't let go <br />
We are alone, just you and me <br />
Up in your room and our slates are clean <br />
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes <br />

So you were never a saint <br />
And I've loved in shades of wrong <br />
We learn to live with the pain <br />
Mosaic broken hearts <br />
But this love is brave and wild <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I never (never) <br />
Saw you coming <br />
And I'll never (never) <br />
Be the same <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is a state of grace <br />
This is the worthwhile fight <br />
Love is a ruthless game <br />
Unless you play it good and right <br />
These are the hands of fate <br />
You're my Achilles heel <br />
This is the golden age of something good and right and real <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I never (never) <br />
Saw you coming <br />
And I'll never <br />
Be the same <br />
And I never (never) <br />
Saw you coming <br />
And I'll never (so you were never a saint) <br />
(And I've loved in shades of wrong) <br />
Be the same (we learn to live with the pain) <br />
(Mosaic broken hearts) <br />
(But this love is brave and wild) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
This is a state of grace <br />
This is the worthwhile fight <br />
Love is a ruthless game <br />
Unless you play it good and right <br />
