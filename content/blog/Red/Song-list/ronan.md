<p className="verse-one">
I remember your bare feet down the hallway <br />
I remember your little laugh <br />
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs <br />
I love you to the moon and back <br />
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine <br />
Like we had our own secret club <br />
I remember you dancing before bedtime <br />
Then jumping on me, waking me up <br />
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man <br />
And even the moment I knew <br />
You fought it hard like an army guy <br />
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come on, baby, with me <br />
We're gonna fly away from here <br />
You were my best four years <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I remember the drive home when the blind hope <br />
Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?" <br />
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say <br />
About a beautiful boy who died <br />
And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything <br />
You wanted if you were still here <br />
I remember the last day when I kissed your face <br />
And whispered in your ear <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come on, baby, with me <br />
We're gonna fly away from here <br />
Out of this curtained room <br />
In this hospital grey, we'll just disappear <br />
Come on, baby, with me <br />
We're gonna fly away from here <br />
You were my best four years <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
What if I'm standing in your closet <br />
Trying to talk to you? <br />
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs <br />
You won't grow into? <br />
And what if I really thought some miracle <br />
Would see us through? <br />
What if the miracle was even getting <br />
One moment with you? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come on, baby, with me <br />
We're gonna fly away from here <br />
Come on, baby, with me <br />
We're gonna fly away from here <br />
You were my best four years <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I remember your bare feet down the hallway <br />
I love you to the moon and back <br />
