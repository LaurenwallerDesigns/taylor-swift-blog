<p className="verse-one">
I know I'm probably better off on my own <br />
Than lovin' a man who didn't know <br />
What he had when he had it <br />
And I see the permanent damage you did to me <br />
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I wish it wasn't 4am, standing in the mirror <br />
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it <br />
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br />
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br />
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand <br />
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br />
A better man <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I know I'm probably better off all alone <br />
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute <br />
And it was always on your terms <br />
I waited on every careless word <br />
Hoping it might turn sweet again <br />
Like it was in the beginning <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now <br />
You're talking down to me like I'll always be around <br />
You push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun <br />
Oh, you never thought I'd run <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br />
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br />
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand <br />
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br />
A better man <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have <br />
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that <br />
I wish you were a better man <br />
I wonder what we would've become <br />
If you were a better man <br />
We might still be in love <br />
If you were a better man <br />
You would've been the one <br />
If you were a better man <br />
Yeah, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br />
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man<br />
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand<br />
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man<br />
A better man<br />
<br />
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br />
(We might still be in love, if you were a better man)<br />
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man<br />
I know why we had to say goodbye<br />
Like the back of my hand<br />
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man<br />
A better man<br />
We might still be in love, if you were a better man<br />
You would've been the one<br />
If you were a better man<br />
