<p className="verse-one">
Find myself at your door <br />
Just like all those times before <br />
I'm not sure how I got there <br />
All roads, they lead me here <br />
I imagine you are home <br />
In your room, all alone <br />
And you open your eyes into mine <br />
And everything feels better <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And right before your eyes <br />
I'm breaking <br />
No past, no reasons why <br />
Just you and me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is the last time I'm asking you this <br />
Put my name at the top of your list <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you why <br />
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You find yourself at my door <br />
Just like all those times before <br />
You wear your best apology <br />
But I was there to watch you leave <br />
And all the times I let you in <br />
Just for you to go again <br />
Disappear when you come back <br />
Everything is better <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And right before your eyes <br />
I'm aching <br />
Run fast, nowhere to hide <br />
Just you and me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is the last time I'm asking you this <br />
Put my name at the top of your list <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you why <br />
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong <br />
This is the last time I say it's been you all along <br />
This is the last time I let you in my door <br />
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore <br />
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh <br />
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is the last time I'm asking you this <br />
Put my name at the top of your list <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you why <br />
You break my heart in the blink of an eye <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
This is the last time I'm asking you this <br />
(This is the last time I'm asking you this) <br />
Put my name at the top of your list <br />
(Put my name at the top of your list) <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you why <br />
(This is the last time I'm asking you why) <br />
You break my heart in the blink of an eye <br />
(You break my heart) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
This is the last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you this <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you this <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you this <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you this <br />
</p>
