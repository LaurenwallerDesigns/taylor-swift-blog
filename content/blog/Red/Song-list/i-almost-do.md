<p className="verse-one">
I bet <br />
This time of night you're still up <br />
I bet <br />
You're tired from a long hard week <br />
I bet <br />
You're sittin' in your chair by the window <br />
Looking out at the city <br />
And I bet <br />
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanna tell you <br />
It takes everything in me not to call you <br />
And I wish I could run to you <br />
And I hope you know that every time I don't  <br />
I almost do <br />
I almost do <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I bet <br />
You think I either moved on or hate you <br />
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply <br />
I bet <br />
It never ever occurred to you <br />
That I can't say "Hello" to you <br />
And risk another goodbye <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanna tell you <br />
It takes everything in me not to call you <br />
And I wish I could run to you <br />
And I hope you know that every time I don't <br />
I almost do <br />
I almost do <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe <br />
It's probably better off this way <br />
And I confess, babe <br />
In my dreams you're touching my face <br />
And asking me if I wanna try again with you <br />
And I almost do <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanna tell you <br />
It takes everything in me, not to call you <br />
And I wish I could run to you <br />
And I hope you know that every time I don't <br />
I almost do <br />
I almost do <br />
Uh-uh-uh <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I bet <br />
This time of night you're still up <br />
I bet <br />
You're tired from a long hard week <br />
I bet <br />
You're sittin' in your chair by the window <br />
Looking out at the city <br />
And I hope <br />
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me  <br />
