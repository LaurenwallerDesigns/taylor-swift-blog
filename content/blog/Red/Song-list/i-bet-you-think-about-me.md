<p className="verse-one">
3 a.m. and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine <br />
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine <br />
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree <br />
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles <br />
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love <br />
Oh, they sit around talkin' 'bout the meaning of life <br />
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But now that we're done and it's over <br />
I bet you couldn't believe <br />
When you realized I'm harder to forget, than I was to leave <br />
And I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community <br />
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills <br />
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion <br />
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-four">
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for <br />
And you and I fell like an early spring snow <br />
But reality crept in, you said we're too different <br />
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Mr. Superior-Thinkin' <br />
Do you have all the space that you need? <br />
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy <br />
And I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I bet you think about me, yes <br />
I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Ooh, block it all out <br />
The voices so loud sayin', "Why did you let her go?" <br />
Does it make you feel sad <br />
That the love that you're lookin' for <br />
Is the love that you had? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-five">
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul <br />
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old <br />
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free <br />
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But now that we're done and it's over <br />
I bet it's hard to believe <br />
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave <br />
Then, yeah, I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I bet you think about me, yes <br />
I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I bet you think about me when you're out <br />
At your cool indie music concerts every week <br />
I bet you think about me in your house <br />
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch <br />
I bet you think about me when you say <br />
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me" <br />
I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
