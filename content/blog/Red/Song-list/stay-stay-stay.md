<p className='verse-one'>
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night <br />
I threw my phone across the room at you <br />
I was expecting some dramatic turn away <br />
But you stayed <br />
This morning I said we should talk about it <br />
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved  <br />
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet <br />
And said, "Okay, let's talk" <br />
And I said <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Stay, stay, stay <br />
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br />
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br />
But I think that it's best if we both stay <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Before you, I'd only dated self indulgent takers <br />
Who took all of their problem out on me <br />
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing <br />
And I love you, because you have given me no choice but to <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Stay, stay, stay <br />
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br />
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br />
But I think that it's best if we both stay <br />
Stay, stay, stay <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You took the time to memorize me <br />
My fears, my hopes and dreams <br />
I just like hanging out with you <br />
All the time <br />
All those times that you didn't leave <br />
It's been occurring to me <br />
I'd like to hang out with you <br />
For my whole life <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Stay <br />
And I'll be loving you for quite some time <br />
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad <br />
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay <br />
Stay, stay, stay <br />
Stay, stay, stay <br />
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br />
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br />
But I think that it's best if we both stay <br />
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Stay, stay, stay <br />
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br />
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br />
I think that it's best if we both stay <br />
"That's so fun" <br />
</p>
