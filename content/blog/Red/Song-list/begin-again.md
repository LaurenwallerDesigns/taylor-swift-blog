<p className="verse-one">
Took a deep breath in the mirror <br />
He didn't like it when I wore high heels <br />
But I do <br />
Turn the lock and put my headphones on <br />
He always said he didn't get this song <br />
But I do, I do <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Walked in expecting you'd be late <br />
But you got here early and you stand and wave <br />
I walk to you <br />
You pull my chair out and help me in <br />
And you don't know how nice that is <br />
But I do <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And you throw your head back laughing <br />
Like a little kid <br />
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny, 'cause <br />
He never did <br />
I've been spending the last eight months <br />
Thinking all love ever does <br />
Is break and burn, and end <br />
But on a Wednesday in a cafe <br />
I watched it begin again <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
You said you never met one girl who had <br />
As many James Taylor records as you <br />
But I do <br />
We tell stories and you don't know why <br />
I'm coming off a little shy <br />
But I do <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But you throw your head back laughing <br />
Like a little kid <br />
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny, 'cause <br />
He never did <br />
I've been spending the last eight months <br />
Thinking all love ever does <br />
Is break and burn, and end <br />
But on a Wednesday in a cafe <br />
I watched it begin again <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And we walked down the block, to my car <br />
And I almost brought him up <br />
But you start to talk about the movies <br />
That your family watches every single Christmas <br />
And I want to talk about that <br />
And for the first time <br />
What's past is past <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause you throw your head back laughing <br />
Like a little kid <br />
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny, 'cause <br />
He never did <br />
I've been spending the last eight months <br />
Thinking all love ever does <br />
Is break and burn, and end <br />
But on a Wednesday in a cafe <br />
I watched it begin again <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
But on a Wednesday in a cafe <br />
I watched it begin again <br />
