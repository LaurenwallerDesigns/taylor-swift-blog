<p className="intro">
What about your promises, promises? <br />
What about your promises, promises, promises? No <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
What a shame <br />
Didn't want to be the one that got away, yeah <br />
Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise <br />
That you never should have made <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I'm here on the kitchen floor <br />
You call, but I won't hear it <br />
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You really blew this, babe <br />
We ain't getting through this one, babe (yeah, yeah, yeah) <br />
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe  <br />
(This is the last time, this is the last time) <br />
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe <br />
(What about your promises, promises, promises? No) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
What a waste <br />
Taking down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah <br />
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent <br />
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I break down every time you call <br />
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball <br />
We said no one else, how could you do this, babe? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You really blew this, babe <br />
We ain't getting through this one, babe (yea, yea, yea) <br />
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe <br />
(This is the last time, this is the last time) <br />
This is the last time I'll ever call you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Since you admitted it (oh-oh), I keep picturing (oh-oh) <br />
Her lips on your neck (oh-oh), I can't unsee it (oh-oh) <br />
I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
What a shame <br />
Didn't want to be the one that got away <br />
How could you do this, babe? (Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You really blew this, babe (babe, eh, yeah, eh) <br />
We ain't getting through this one, babe (yeah, yeah, yeah) <br />
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe <br />
(This is the last time, this is the last time) <br />
This is the last time I'll ever call you <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I'm here on the kitchen floor <br />
You call, but I won't hear it <br />
You said no one else <br />
We ain't getting through this one, babe <br />
I break down every time you call <br />
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball <br />
You said no one else <br />
This is the last time I'll never call you, babe (yeah, yeah, yeah) <br />
