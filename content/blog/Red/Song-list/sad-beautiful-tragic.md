<p className="verse-one">
Long handwritten note <br />
Deep in your pocket <br />
Words, how little they mean <br />
When you're a little too late <br />
I stood right by the tracks <br />
Your face in a locket <br />
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We had a beautiful magic love there <br />
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
In dreams <br />
I meet you in warm conversation <br />
We both wake <br />
In lonely beds <br />
In different cities <br />
And time <br />
Is taking its sweet time erasing you <br />
And you've got your demons <br />
And darlin' they all look like me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there <br />
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Distance, timing <br />
Breakdown, fighting <br />
Silence, the train runs off its tracks <br />
Kiss me, try to fix it <br />
Could you just try to listen? <br />
Hang up, give up <br />
For the life of us we can't get back <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
A beautiful magic love there <br />
What a sad <br />
Beautiful tragic <br />
Beautiful tragic <br />
Beautiful <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What we had a beautiful magic love there (uh-uh) <br />
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair <br />
We had a beautiful magic love there <br />
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair <br />
</p>
