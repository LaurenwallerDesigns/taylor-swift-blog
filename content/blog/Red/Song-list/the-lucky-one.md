<p className="verse-one">
New to town with a made-up name <br />
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame <br />
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream <br />
You had it figured out since you were in school <br />
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool <br />
So overnight, you look like a '60s queen <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Another name goes up in lights <br />
Like diamonds in the sky <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
But can you tell me now you're the lucky one? <br />
Oh, oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Now it's big black cars and Riviera views <br />
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you <br />
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page <br />
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused <br />
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used <br />
And all the young things line up to take your place <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Another name goes up in lights <br />
You wonder if you'll make it out alive <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Can you tell me now you're the lucky one? <br />
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh <br />
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
It was a few years later, I showed up here <br />
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared <br />
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out <br />
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere <br />
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square <br />
And it took some time, but I understand it now <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause now my name is up in lights <br />
But I think you got it right <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Oh, oh, oh <br />
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Oh, oh, oh <br />
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh <br />
