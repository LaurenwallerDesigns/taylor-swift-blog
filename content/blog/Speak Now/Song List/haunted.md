 <br />
You and I walk a fragile line <br />
I have known it all this time <br />
But I never thought I'd live to see it break <br />
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet <br />
And I can't trust anything now <br />
And it's comin' over you like it's all a big mistake <br />
Whoa, holding my breath <br />
Won't lose you again <br />
Something's made your eyes go cold <br />
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted <br />
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Can't breathe whenever you're gone <br />
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted <br />
Stood there and watched you walk away <br />
From everything we had <br />
But I still mean every word I said to you <br />
He will try to take away my pain <br />
And he just might make me smile <br />
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead <br />
Oh, holding my breath <br />
Won't see you again <br />
Something keeps me holding on to nothing <br />
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted <br />
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Can't breathe whenever you're gone <br />
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted <br />
I know <br />
I know <br />
I just know <br />
You're not gone, you can't be gone <br />
No <br />
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Something's gone terribly wrong, won't finish what you started <br />
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Can't breathe whenever you're gone <br />
Can't go back, I'm haunted <br />
Oh, oh, oh, oh <br />
You and I walk a fragile line <br />
I have known it all this time <br />
Never ever thought I'd see it break <br />
Never thought I'd see it <br />
