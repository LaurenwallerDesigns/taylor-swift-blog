I am not the kind of girl <br />
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion <br />
But you are not the kind of boy <br />
Who should be marrying the wrong girl <br />
I sneak in and see your friends <br />
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel <br />
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid <br />
Somewhere back inside a room <br />
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry <br />
This is surely not what you thought it would be <br />
I lose myself in a daydream <br />
Where I stand and say <br />
Don't say yes, run away now <br />
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door <br />
Don't wait, or say a single vow <br />
You need to hear me out <br />
And they said, "Speak now" <br />
Fond gestures are exchanged <br />
And the organ starts to play <br />
A song that sounds like a death march <br />
And I am hiding in the curtains <br />
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be <br />
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen <br />
But I know you wish it was me <br />
You wish it was me <br />
Don't you? <br />
Don't say yes, run away now <br />
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door <br />
Don't wait, or say a single vow <br />
You need to hear me out <br />
And they said, "Speak now" <br />
Don't say yes, run away now <br />
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door <br />
Don't wait, or say a single vow <br />
Your time is running out <br />
And they said, "Speak now" <br />
I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace" <br />
There's the silence, there's my last chance <br />
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me <br />
Horrified looks from everyone in the room <br />
But I'm only looking at you <br />
I am not the kind of girl <br />
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion <br />
But you are not the kind of boy <br />
Who should be marrying the wrong girl <br />
So don't say yes, run away now <br />
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door <br />
Don't wait, or say a single vow <br />
You need to hear me out <br />
And they said, "Speak now" <br />
And you'll say, "Let's run away now" <br />
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door <br />
Baby, I didn't say my vows <br />
So glad you were around <br />
When they said, "Speak now" <br />
