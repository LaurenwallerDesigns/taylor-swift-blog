<p className="verse-one">
You have a way of coming easily to me <br />
And when you take, you take the very best of me <br />
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel somethin' <br />
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, what a shame <br />
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day <br />
Just walk away <br />
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say <br />
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through <br />
I've never been anywhere cold as you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You put up the walls and paint them all a shade of gray <br />
And I stood there loving you, and wished them all away <br />
And you come away with a great little story <br />
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, what a shame <br />
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day <br />
Just walk away <br />
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say <br />
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through <br />
I've never been anywhere cold as you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You never did give a damn thing, honey <br />
But I cried, cried for you <br />
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you <br />
Died for you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, what a shame <br />
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day <br />
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending <br />
Countin' all the scars you've made <br />
Now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through <br />
I've never been anywhere cold as you <br />
</p>
