<p className="verse-one">
I didn't know what I would find <br />
When I went lookin' for a reason <br />
I know I didn't read between the lines <br />
And baby I've got nowhere to go <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I tried to take the road less traveled by <br />
But nothing seems to work the first few times, am I right? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So, how can I ever try to be better? <br />
Nobody ever let's me in <br />
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view <br />
On the outside looking in <br />
I've been a lot of lonely places <br />
I've never been on the outside <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You saw me there but never knew <br />
That I would give it all up to be <br />
A part of this, a part of you <br />
And now it's all too late so you see <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You could have helped if you had wanted to <br />
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
How can I ever try to be better? <br />
Nobody ever let's me in <br />
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view <br />
On the outside looking in <br />
I've been a lot of lonely places <br />
I've never been on the outside <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Oh yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
How can I ever try to be better? <br />
Nobody ever let's me in <br />
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view <br />
On the outside looking in <br />
I've been a lot of lonely places <br />
I've never been on the outside <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, oh, oh-oh <br />
Oh, oh-oh <br />
