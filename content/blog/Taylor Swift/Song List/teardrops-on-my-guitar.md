Drew looks at me <br />
I fake a smile so he won't see <br />
What I want and I need <br />
And everything that we should be <br />
I'll bet she's beautiful <br />
That girl he talks about <br />
And she's got everything <br />
That I have to live without <br />
Drew talks to me <br />
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny <br />
But I can't even see <br />
Anyone when he's with me <br />
He says he's so in love <br />
He's finally got it right <br />
I wonder if he knows <br />
He's all I think about at night <br />
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar <br />
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star <br />
He's the song in the car I keep singing <br />
Don't know why I do <br />
Drew walks by me <br />
Can he tell that I can't breathe? <br />
And there he goes, so perfectly <br />
The kind of flawless I wish I could be <br />
She better hold him tight <br />
Give him all her love <br />
Look in those beautiful eyes <br />
And know she's lucky 'cause <br />
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar <br />
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star <br />
He's the song in the car I keep singing <br />
Don't know why I do <br />
So I drive home alone <br />
As I turn out the light <br />
I'll put his picture down <br />
And maybe get some sleep tonight <br />
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar <br />
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart <br />
He's the song in the car I keep singing <br />
Don't know why I do <br />
He's the time taken up but there's never enough <br />
And he's all that I need to fall into <br />
Drew looks at me <br />
I fake a smile so he won't see <br />
