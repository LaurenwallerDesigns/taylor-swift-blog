<p className="verse-one">
He said the way my blue eyes shined <br />
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night <br />
I said, "That's a lie" <br />
Just a boy in a Chevy truck <br />
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck <br />
On back roads at night <br />
And I was right there beside him all summer long <br />
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But when you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think my favorite song <br />
The one we danced to all night long <br />
The moon like a spotlight on the lake <br />
When you think happiness <br />
I hope you think that little black dress <br />
Think of my head on your chest <br />
And my old faded blue jeans <br />
When you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think of me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
September saw a month of tears <br />
And thankin' God that you weren't here <br />
To see me like that <br />
But in a box beneath my bed <br />
Is a letter that you never read <br />
From three summers back <br />
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet <br />
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think my favorite song <br />
The one we danced to all night long <br />
The moon like a spotlight on the lake <br />
When you think happiness <br />
I hope you think that little black dress <br />
Think of my head on your chest <br />
And my old faded blue jeans <br />
When you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think of me <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I'm back for the first time since then <br />
I'm standin' on your street <br />
And there's a letter left on your doorstep <br />
And the first thing that you'll read <br />
Is when you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think my favorite song <br />
Someday you'll turn your radio on <br />
I hope it takes you back to that place <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When you think happiness <br />
I hope you think that little black dress <br />
Think of my head on your chest <br />
And my old faded blue jeans <br />
When you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think of me <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, think of me, hmm <br />
He said the way my blue eyes shined <br />
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night <br />
I said, "That's a lie" <br />
