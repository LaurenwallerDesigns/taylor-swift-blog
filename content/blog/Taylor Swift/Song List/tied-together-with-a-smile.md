<p className="verse-one">
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty <br />
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you <br />
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty <br />
But that's not true <br />
'Cause I know you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hold on, baby, you're losing it <br />
The water's high, you're jumping into it <br />
And letting go and no one knows <br />
That you cry but you don't tell anyone <br />
That you might not be the golden one <br />
And you're tied together with a smile <br />
But you're coming undone <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted <br />
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change <br />
Hoping it will end up in his pocket <br />
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain <br />
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay <br />
It's not his price to pay <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hold on, baby, you're losing it <br />
The water's high, you're jumping into it <br />
And letting go and no one knows <br />
That you cry but you don't tell anyone <br />
That you might not be the golden one <br />
And you're tied together with a smile <br />
But you're coming undone <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hold on, baby, you're losing it <br />
The water's high, you're jumping into it <br />
And letting go and no one knows <br />
That you cry but you don't tell anyone <br />
That you might not be the golden one <br />
And you're tied together with a smile <br />
But you're coming undone <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You're tied together with a smile <br />
But you're coming undone <br />
Oh woah woah <br />
Goodbye, baby <br />
With a smile, baby, baby <br />
Oh-oh <br />
</p>
