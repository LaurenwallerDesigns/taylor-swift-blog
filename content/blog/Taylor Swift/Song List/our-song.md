<p className="intro">
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone <br />
In the front seat of his car <br />
He's got a one-hand feel on the steerin' wheel <br />
The other on my heart <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
I look around, turn the radio down <br />
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?" <br />
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' <br />
How we don't have a song" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And he says <br />
Our song is the slammin' screen door <br />
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window <br />
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow <br />
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know <br />
Our song is the way you laugh <br />
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have" <br />
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen <br />
Askin' God if he could play it again <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I was walkin' up the front porch steps <br />
After everything that day <br />
Had gone all wrong, had been trampled on <br />
And lost and thrown away <br />
Got to the hallway, well on my way <br />
To my lovin' bed <br />
I almost didn't notice all the roses <br />
And the note that said <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Our song is the slammin' screen door <br />
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window <br />
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow <br />
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know <br />
Our song is the way you laugh <br />
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have" <br />
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen <br />
Askin' God if he could play it again <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Da-da-da, da <br />
I've heard every album, listened to the radio <br />
Waited for somethin' to come along <br />
That was as good as our song <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door <br />
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window <br />
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow <br />
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know <br />
Our song is the way he laughs <br />
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have" <br />
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen <br />
Askin' God if he could play it again <br />
Play it again <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, yeah <br />
Oh, oh, yeah <br />
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone <br />
In the front seat of his car <br />
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin <br />
And I wrote down our song <br />
