<p className="verse-one">
Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind <br />
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind <br />
In the shoes I gave you as a present <br />
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five <br />
And by the way, I'm going out tonight <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Best believe I'm still bejeweled <br />
When I walk in the room <br />
I can still make the whole place shimmer <br />
And when I meet the band <br />
They ask, "Do you have a man?" <br />
I can still say, "I don't remember" <br />
Familiarity breeds contempt <br />
Don't put me in the basement <br />
When I want the penthouse of your heart <br />
Diamonds in my eyes <br />
I polish up real, I polish up real nice <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Nice <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl) <br />
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (huh), have you heard? (Huh) <br />
I can reclaim the land <br />
And I miss you (I miss you) <br />
But I miss sparkling (ah, hey) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Best believe I'm still bejeweled <br />
When I walk in the room <br />
I can still make the whole place shimmer <br />
And when I meet the band <br />
They ask, "Do you have a man?" <br />
I can still say, "I don't remember" <br />
Familiarity breeds contempt <br />
Don't put me in the basement <br />
When I want the penthouse of your heart <br />
Diamonds in my eyes <br />
I polish up real, I polish up real nice <br />
Nice <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Sapphire tears on my face <br />
Sadness became my whole sky <br />
But some guy said my aura's moonstone <br />
Just 'cause he was high <br />
And we're dancin' all night <br />
And you can try to change my mind <br />
But you might have to wait in line <br />
What's a girl gonna do? <br />
A diamond's gotta shine <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Best believe I'm still bejeweled <br />
When I walk in the room <br />
I can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer) <br />
And when I meet the band <br />
They ask, "Do you have a man?" <br />
I can still say, "I don't remember" <br />
Familiarity breeds contempt <br />
Don't put me in the basement <br />
When I want the penthouse of your heart <br />
Diamonds in my eyes <br />
I polish up real (nice), I polish up real nice <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
And we're dancin' all night <br />
And you can try to change my mind <br />
But you might have to wait in line <br />
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do? <br />
I polish up nice <br />
Best believe I'm still bejeweled <br />
When I walk in the room <br />
I can still make the whole place shimmer <br />
