<p className="verse-one">
Once upon a time, the planets and the fates <br />
And all the stars aligned <br />
You and I ended up in the same room <br />
At the same time <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse <br />
Of a chain reaction of countermoves <br />
To assess the equation of you <br />
Checkmate, I couldn't lose <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What if I told you none of it was accidental <br />
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me? <br />
I laid the groundwork and then, just like clockwork <br />
The dominoes cascaded in a line <br />
What if I told you I'm a mastermind? <br />
And now you're mine <br />
It was all by design <br />
'Cause I'm a mastermind <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You see, all the wisest women <br />
Had to do it this way <br />
'Cause we were born to be the pawn <br />
In every lover's game <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail <br />
Strategy sets the scene for the tale <br />
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails <br />
And the liquor in our cocktails <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What if I told you none of it was accidental <br />
And the first night that you saw me, I knew I wanted your body? <br />
I laid the groundwork and then, just like clockwork <br />
The dominoes cascaded in a line <br />
What if I told you I'm a mastermind? <br />
And now you're mine <br />
It was all my design <br />
'Cause I'm a mastermind <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid <br />
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since <br />
To make them love me and make it seem effortless <br />
This this the first time I've felt the need to confess <br />
And I swear <br />
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So I told you none of it was accidental <br />
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me <br />
I laid the groundwork and then saw a wide smirk <br />
On your face, you knew the entire time <br />
You knew that I'm a mastermind <br />
And now you're mine <br />
Yeah, all you did was smile <br />
'Cause I'm a mastermind <br />
</p>
