<p className="verse-one">
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser <br />
Midnights become my afternoons <br />
When my depression works the graveyard shift <br />
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I should not be left to my own devices <br />
They come with prices and vices <br />
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time) <br />
I wake up screaming from dreaming <br />
One day I'll watch as you're leaving <br />
'Cause you got tired of my scheming <br />
(For the last time) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me <br />
At tea time, everybody agrees <br />
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror <br />
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby <br />
And I'm a monster on the hill <br />
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city <br />
Pierced through the heart, but never killed <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism <br />
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time) <br />
I wake up screaming from dreaming <br />
One day I'll watch as you're leaving <br />
And life will lose all its meaning <br />
(For the last time) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) <br />
At tea time, everybody agrees <br />
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror <br />
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money <br />
She thinks I left them in the will <br />
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out <br />
"She's laughing up at us from hell" <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me <br />
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me <br />
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) <br />
At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees) <br />
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror <br />
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero <br />
