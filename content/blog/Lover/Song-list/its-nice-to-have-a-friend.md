… School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?"
"Yeah, sounds like fun"
Video games
You pass me a note
Sleeping in tents
… It's nice to have a friend
It's nice to have a friend
… Light pink sky
Up on the roof
Sun sinks down
No curfew
20 questions
We tell the truth
You been stressed out lately
Yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand
… It's nice to have a friend
It's nice to have a friend
… Church bells ring
Carry me home
Rice on the ground
Looks like snow
Call my bluff
Call you "babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home
Stay in bed
The whole weekend
… It's nice to have a friend
It's nice to have a friend
It's nice to have a friend
